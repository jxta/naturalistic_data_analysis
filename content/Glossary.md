# Glossary
Throughout this course we will use a variety of different functions available in the base Python library, but also many other libraries in the scientific computing stack. Here we provide a list of all of the functions that are used across the various notebooks. It can be a helpful reference when you are learning Python about the types of things you can do with various packages. Remember you can always view the docstrings for any function by adding a `?` to the end of the function name.
