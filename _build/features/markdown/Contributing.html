<p>One of the wonderful aspects of both the neuroimaging and Python scientific computing communities is the strong commitment to developing and sharing knowledge and tools within the broader community. The goal of  this project is to provide a resource for people to learn about how to analyze naturalistic neuroimaging data. We try to incorporate as much open content as we can find that contributes to this goal. Please let us know if we have inadvertently omitted credit for any content generated by others. Though this course was originally developed for an OHBM educational workshop, we welcome contributions from anyone in the broader imaging community. In particular, we welcome tutorials with new methods, recorded talks of applications of interesting methods to naturalistic data, and corrections to any of our materials.</p>
